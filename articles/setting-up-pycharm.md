## Getting started

**PyCharm** is an integrated development environment (IDE) for the Python programming language.

Before you start working, you need to install the IDE. Download PyCharm from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) — 
the Professional version includes a 30-day free trial — and install it on your system. To start using PyCharm, 
you’ll need to create a [JetBrains account](https://account.jetbrains.com/signup). Then open the IDE, 
sign in with your credentials, and open your project.

**Note**: The free version of PyCharm has limited functionality — for example, it doesn’t support Docker- or 
Compose-based Python interpreters — which makes it unsuitable for commercial development.

Based Keyboard **Shortcuts**:

- `Ctrl + D` or `Command + D` – duplicate the current line below the cursor.

- `Ctrl + Shift + K` or `Command + Shift + K` – push to a remote Git repository.

- `Double Shift` – search for files by name.

- `Ctrl + Shift + F` or `Command + Shift + F` – search across all files by content.

- `Ctrl + /` or `Command + /` – comment or uncomment the selected line(s).

- `Tab / Shift + Tab` – indent or unindent the selected block of code.

- `Ctrl + Click` or `Command + Click` – navigate to a class, function, file, or variable (including viewing source code of installed libraries).

- `Alt + Enter` or `Option + Enter` – add an import statement for the selected element at the top of the file.
